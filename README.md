We chose react native because we're interested in mobile development and are familiar with react. Leah was made aware of it when Zakk mentioned it on Friday. 
It is used to create well-built mobile applications for both iOS and Android. 
Ionic is one alternative, but instead of building a mobile application is builds a web application that runs on mobile devices. Swift is exclusively for iOS, and Java is exclusively for Android. 
It was built by Facebook, based on React, and announced in 2015. 
It seems like a really cool skill to have. The app seems very structured and predictable. 
Navigation was difficul to to understand. 
the React documentation and http://www.awesome-react-native.com/ are good resources
